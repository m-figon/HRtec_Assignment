# HRtec Assignment

The goal of this project was to create a music-playing widget. Player time counting is accelerated ten times to present options located in the top part of the player (playlist loop, random song, song loop) in an easier way. Website is size adjustable to bigger screens (above 1400px width). Website is adjustable to bigger/smaller fonts set in browser settings.
In default mode, after the song goes next one in the playlist or player stops after it if this is the last song in the playlist.
In repeat playlist mode, after the ending of the last song, the first song is played automatically,
In shuffle mode, after one song, default song which isn't this particular song is played automatically,
In repeat song mode after one song, the same song is played automatically.
The time when a song ends is different for every song.
